Explain the differences in execution time:

Without if statement:
    real    0m11,290s
    user    0m11,218s
    sys     0m0,016s
With if statement:
    real    0m8,591s
    user    0m8,516s
    sys     0m0,020s

More operations result in a slightly longer run time.

formulate a general rule of thumb:

you should always check the state of an output stream 
operation before actually adding items into the stream,
because it might yield unnecessary error messages.
