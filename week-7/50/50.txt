Explain this outcome, and show how the program can be fixed:

the class fstream is more general than ofstream. It can be used to input and
to output text. Therefore, we need to fix the program by supplying whether we
want to input and output text:

    fstream out2{ "/tmp/out2", ios::out };

the complete fixed program will be attached.
