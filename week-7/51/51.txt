The output is not what was shown, because the istringstream is set to a
specific error state flag after reading input, e.g. goodbit if the number was
read successfully without errors. A flag saves the status of the stream as one
of its attributes, i.e. the flag serves the purpose of saving whether
the last read input was erroneous or not. The flag hence also saves whether
there is something already saved in the stream, which is the problem here.
Since a number has already been read, the stream can't be filled again.
Thus, a second number cannot be read without first clearing the flags and
reseting the stream. That's why, to fix the program, we just inserted the line

    istr.clear();

before line 21, where the next string is read (istr.str(argv[2])).
