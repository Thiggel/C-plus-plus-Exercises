The output is not what was shown, because the istringstream is set to a
specific flag after reading input, e.g. goodbit if the number was read
successfully without errors. Thus, a second number cannot be read without
first clearing the flags and reseting the stream. That's why, to fix the
program, we just inserted the line

    istr.clear();

before line 21, where the next string is read (istr.str(argv[2])).
