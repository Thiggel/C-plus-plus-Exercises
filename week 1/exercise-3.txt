1. Is a valid c++ program

2. Is not a valid c++ program. The third argument of the main function does not exist and should be removed to produce a valid program.

3. Is not a valid program. "return;" without a return value can only be used in void functions. Hence, it should be "return 0;" or, as a best practice, the return statement should just be left out as the compiler will include it automatically.

4. It is a valid c++ program. The size of an object of type "char" is 1, so that 'c' has size 1 as well and the statement is true.

5. argc is the number of elements in the argv array. Therefore, the last element in argv is argv[argc - 1]. From that it follows that argv[argc] gives an error as it is out of the bounds of the array.

6. "exit(0)" will end a program immediately. However, we would not consider it best pratice at all, as it might lead to the program not terminated correctly, i.e. memory might not be freed correctly.

7. True. In C, you would need the "typedef" so that you can just declare "Name foo;" instead of "enum Name foo;". In C++, this already is the case without using "typedef"

8. True
