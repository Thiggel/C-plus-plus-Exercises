Compile the library and create the .a file:

% for FILE in *.cpp; do g++ --std=c++20 -Wall -Werror -c $FILE -o objectFiles/$FILE.o; done
% cd objectFiles/
% ar rcs libcppmath.a *.o

Link library to main file:

% g++ --std=c++20 -Wall -Werror 23.cpp libcppmath/objectFiles/libcppmath.a

Sizes of executables:

When linked to .a file: 51624 bytes
When linked to .o file: 51256 bytes

When linked to the .o file, the size of the executable is 368 bytes smaller than when linked to the .a file.
This is due to the fact that a .a file is an archive that contains one or more object files that together
form a library. Hence, it contains more data than a simple object file, because libcppmath.o is just the object
file but libcppmath.a contains this very object file plus additional meta data.
