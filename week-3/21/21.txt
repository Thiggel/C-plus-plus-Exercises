1. define an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to use an int-type parameter when you want to pass an integer through a function, whether to manipulate it or to make use of it for some form of arithmetic. The reason to use int, over a reference is that passing int directly is slightly faster as it won't have to be de-referenced later. On a larger scale, this could make a difference.

In the code example this is illustrated because the value of the parameter is changed using arithmetic;

int multiply(int num)
{
    num = num * 2;
    return num;
}


2. define a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to use an std::string parameter when you want to execute operations
defined in that class on said object and/or can't save the value you're trying to represent in
a more primitive type.

In the code example this is illustrated because a std::string is created to save a message that
is then manipulated, and all of that could not be done with types like int or char.

std::string printStr(std::string str)
{
    str += " is very nice.";
    str.insert(0, "The string");

    return str
}


3. define a const reference to an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to use a const reference to an int-type parameter when the variable passed as the parameter
shall be changed from inside the function, and it is not const itself (since in that case the function couldn't
change the variable the reference points to, and thus it would be superfluous to define the parameter as a reference).
If the reference itself is not to be changed anymore, the const is appropriate.

In the code example this is illustrated because a const int reference is defined as a parameter and the reference
inside the function is not changed anymore, while the variable the reference points to is changed.

void multiply(const int &num)
{
    num = num * 2;
}


4. define a const reference to a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to define a const reference to an std::string value if the reference itself will not be changed,
the variable it points to is not const (as explained above), the variable it points to shall be changed from
inside the function, and it is not possible to represent the value in a more primitive data type.

In the code example this is illustrated because a piece of text that cannot be represented otherwise
is referenced and changed from within the function.

void changeStr(const std::string &str)
{
    str += " is very nice.";
    str.insert(0, "The string ");
}


5. define a non-const reference to an int-type parameter?

It is appropriate to define a non-const reference to an int-type parameter when you want to change the value
of the variable the reference points to and the reference itself.

In the code example this is illustrated because a reference is passed to a function through which the variable it
refers to is changed, but also the reference itself is changed to point to a different variable after.

int &multiply(int &num)
{
    num = num * 2;
    int num2 = 50;
    &num = &num2;

    return &num;
}


6. define a non-const reference to a std::string value parameter?

It is appropriate to define a non-const reference to a std::string value when the variable is not
representable in a primitive type, the value itself must be changed from inside the function and the reference
to the variable itself shall be changed too.

In the code example this is illustrated because I reference to a string is passed, and the string can only be
represented as string and gets manipulated using string methods. Additionally, the reference to the string
itself is changed too.

std:string &changeStr(std::string &str)
{
    str += " is very nice.";
    str.insert(0, "The string ");

    std::string str2 = "Hello";

    &str = &str2;

    return &str;
}


7. define a const rvalue-reference to an int-type parameter?

Int-type parameters cannot be referenced by an rvalue-reference. Rvalue-references refer to objects that don't have direct
values that can be changed directly using assignments. Int-type parameters can only be referenced using lvalue-references.


8. define a const rvalue-reference to a std::string parameter?

It is appropriate to define a const rvalue reference to a std::string parameter if the object itself as an rvalue
will be used in the defined function.



void changeStr(std::string &&str)
{
    str.
}


9. define an rvalue-reference to an int-type parameter?

Int-type parameters cannot be referenced by an rvalue-reference. Rvalue-references refer to objects that don't have direct
values that can be changed directly using assignments. Int-type parameters can only be referenced using lvalue-references.


10. define an rvalue-reference to a std::string parameter?



11. return an int-type value?
It is appropriate to return an int-type value when attempting to end the execution of an int-type function, resulting with
the return to the calling function. The code here illustrates this as the value of the int-type is returned after the
arithmetic is completed in the function.

int sum(int input1, int input2)
{
	return input1+input2;
}


12. return a std::string value?
It is appropriate to return a std::string value when attempting to end the execution of a std::string type function, resulting
with the return to the calling function. The code below illustrates this as std::string value is returned at the end of a
function after being manipulated.

std::string printStr(std::string str)
{
    str += " is very nice.";
    str.insert(0, "The string");

    return str
}


13. return a const reference to an int? 
Returning a const reference to an int is appropriate when you don't want to modify any int-values in a function. Furthermore,
using const references will allow for better efficacy as you won't have to make a copy of the object or primitive. The code
below demonstrates this as it returns a reference to an int, without being modified.

int data[] = {1,2,3,4};

int const &getValue(int index)
{
    return data[index];
}



14. return a const reference to a std::string?
Returning a const reference to a std::string is appropriate when you don't want to modify anything in the string when passing
it through a function as well as keep efficiency as you don't have to copy the std::string object.

string string1 = "yarr harr i'm a pirate";

string const &getString()
{
    return string1;
}


15. return a non-const reference to an int?
It is appropriate to return a non-const reference to an int when attempting to modify for example an int-type array. The code
below illustrates this by modifying an array of data with int-values, then returning the reference to the changed array.

int data[] = {1,2,3,4}

int &modifyData(int index)
{
	return data[index]
}

modifyData(1) = 24; //modify 2nd element in data array

16. return a non-const reference to a std::string?
It is appropriate to return a non-const reference to a std::string when attempting to modify a string without having to copy
the string object in a function. This is useful as it can optimize your code. The code below demonstrates this as there is
a function that modifies a string, then returns it as a reference.

string string1 = "yarr harr i'm a pirate";

string &modifyString(string newString)
{
    return string1;
}

modifyString() = "new string";		//Modify the string

20. return an rvalue-reference to a std::string?
