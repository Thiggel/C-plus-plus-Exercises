1. Operators new and delete on primitive types:

int *num = new int;
// ...
delete num;

Here, memory is allocated for an int and then later released. As some actions
between the new and delete operations might require the dynamic allocation of
memory, this is appropriate.


2. Operators new and delete on class types:

string *str = new string(7, ' ');
// ...
delete str;

Here, a string object is initialized with the new operator, calling its
constructor.
It is later deleted. Inbetween the two statements, the string length might be
changed, reallocating memory for it. Hence, using new and delete is
appropriate here.


3. Operators new[] and delete[]:

std::string *sp = new std::string[10];
// ...
delete[] sp;

Here, memory for an array of strings is allocated, for which new[] is
necessary. Later, it must hence be freed again using delete[]. As the array
size might be changed and memory might be reallocated, it is appropriate to
use new[] and delete[].


4. "operator new" and "operator delete":

string *block = static_cast<string *>(operator new(10 * sizeof(std::string)));

string *str = new(block + 10) "Hello World";
str->~string();

operator delete(block);

Here, raw memory is allocated for an int using "operator new" and later freed
using "operator delete". The raw chunk of memory is first allocated and only
later used when the string that is to be saved is known, which is why it is
appropriately placed here.


5. "placement new":

using std::string;

char buffer[5 * sizeof(string)];
string *str = new(buffer) string [5];

// ...

for (size_t index = 0; index < 5; ++index)
    str[index].~string();

In this example, memory of a specific size is allocated using the "placement
new" operator and can be reallocated later, when the array has to be
enlarged. In this example, the destructor has to be called for every element
of the array to free the memory
