-Acquire some familiarization with the pointer concept.

1) What differences exist between pointer variables and arrays?
One big difference between pointer variables and arrays is that pointers
are VARIABLES. Therefore, operations like pointer=x and pointer++ are legal.
These operations can't be performed on an array name.
For example array++ is illegal.



2) What differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables?
-Reference variables refer to an already declared variable, but with
another name. This is different from a pointer variable, because
pointer variables store the address of a variable.
-Reference variables cannot be reassigned. They are bound to the variable
they refer to from initialization. Pointers can be reassigned to point
to the location of another variable.
-Reference variables share the same memory address as the variable they
refer to whereas pointers have their own unique memory address.
-We can assign the nullptr to a pointer, but not to a reference because
a reference should always refer to something that exists.

3) How element [3][2] is reached (DONT FORGET SENDING DRAWING!!)
case a: for the variable 'int array[20][30]'
See picture
case b: for the variable 'int *pointer[20]'
See picture

4) What is meant by 'pointer arithmetic'?
Pointer arithmetic or 'address arithmetic' is the method of finding or
calculating memory addresses of object by using arithmetic operations,
such as pointer++, on pointer variables. With this you can, for example,
access the elements in an array by incrementing or decrementing a pointer.
