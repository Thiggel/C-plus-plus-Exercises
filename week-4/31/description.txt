In this exercise, the full calculator program from the previous exercises
should be handed in as one coherent program, alongside an interaction with
the program.

Note: the sources for the classes line, parser and calculator were already
published in the previous exercise 28, 29 and 30. Therefore, they will not be
repeated here.
