Describe in your own words what `encapsulation' and `data hiding' means.

Encapsulation is when data and information is bound together to the functions
that manipulate said data. This information is wrapped up and cannot be
accessed by any
functions that are not bound (encapsulated) with the data. 

Data hiding is similar to encapsulation, with the addition that the data can
only be privately defined. Data hiding can be seen as protecting data in a
class from being accessed without authorization.

These are important as they allow for better coupling, as well as making sure
that people can only access things that are supposed to be accessed (prevents
mistakes from being made later down the line).

EXAMPLE:

class Example
{
	private:
		int exampleInt = 0;	  // Example of data hiding - data is hidden
							  // from the rest of the program
							  
	public:
		Example();
		void setExampleInt(int const &input) // Example of encapsulation

	// exampleInt can now only be
	// manipulated
	// through this function.
};
